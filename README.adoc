== Start a server

`cd xtdb-server && ./run.sh`

== psql

Install `psql` if you don't have it already.
Some package managers offer the Postgres client in isolation (ubuntu has `postgresql-client`) but this is surprisingly uncommon.

[source,sh]
----
sudo apt-get install -y postgresql
sudo pacman -S postgresql
brew install postgresql
----

Start a server in `xtdb-server`.

Run `./psql/run.sh` to start a client. Try a query from `./psql`.

## Clojure

The Clojure examples consume Core2 directly, running a client and server in the same process for convenience.
The client code still speaks to Core2 over the `pgwire` protocol.
