== Start a server

`cd xtdb-server && ./run.sh`

== psql

Install `psql` (Postgres) if you don't have it already.
Some package managers offer the Postgres client in isolation (ubuntu has `postgresql-client`) but this is surprisingly uncommon.

[source,sh]
----
sudo apt-get install -y postgresql
sudo pacman -S postgresql
brew install postgresql
# etc.
----

* Start a server in `xtdb-server`
* Run `./psql/run.sh` to start a client
* Try a query from `./psql/queries.sql`

== Clojure

The Clojure examples consume Core2 directly, running a client and server in the same process for convenience.
This means you do not need to start a Core2 server, like normal.
However, the client code still speaks to Core2 over the `pgwire` protocol.

== Python

* Start a server in `xtdb-server`
* Install dependencies: `./python/install.sh`
* Edit and run `./python/queries.py`
